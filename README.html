<b><a>I would like to start by giving a very special thanks to Bob and Irene Brown for many years of publishing, first the FINELINES and then the NGSL GAZETTE magazine.  Also thanks to Keith Wiseman for giving me free space on his WEB site when I lost my space on AOL. I have a new format for the data because Windows 7 does not support my very old DOS program.  I am using Open Office Spreedsheet for my data.<br><br>

<a>Thank you for using the NGSL GAZETTE INDEXES.  I hope you find them of use in searching for narrow gauge railroad articles, drawings, photos, books, videos and product reviews that have been published in the NGSL GAZETTE. <br><br> 

<a>NOTE:  If you do not have the issue with the item you want, and the issue is out of print, you can call contact Bob Brown or check with Cleo Simmonds at    Montage  Worldwide,    P. O. Box 8171,     Shawnee Mission, KS 66208,     www.montageww.com,    816 659 7500<br><br> 


<a>VIEWING THE INDEXES.<br><br>

<a>To SEARCH the data use EDIT/FIND from the menu bar (note:  If you do not see the MENU BAR click on thr Gear symbol to the far right in IE).  Note some entries are in the indexes more than once.  To setup the file for printing (so that a line on the screen will print as one line on the printer), select FILE/PAGE SETUP from the menu bar.  Select the LANDSCAPE option, then click OK. Select FILE/PRINT from the menu bar to print the document.<br><br> 

<a>To print less than one page, highlight the lines you want to print, select EDIT/COPY from the menu bar.  Select the LANDSCAPE option, then select FILE/PRINT, select the SELECTION option, and then click OK.  Another way to print the data is to highlight the data wanted, EDIT/COPY, switch to your WORD PROCESSOR and select EDIT/PASTE, and then print.<br><br>


<a>SUBJECT INDEX.<br><br>

<a>This Subject Index uses a code under "CD" column; "C" is the magazine cover, "D" is for a drawing or plan, "F" is for a feature article, and "P" is a photograph.  The titles of most of the articles were rearranged to facilitate the alphabetized sort by putting the subject word in front.  Example: THE LADY SLIPPER MINE becomes MINE LADY SLIPPER.  Some of the items are listed in the index more than once to make it easier to find them.  Also some special lines in the listing point to where there is more information on a subject.  An example is: DENVER &amp; RIO GRANDE SEE ***** D&RG;, D&RGW;, and C&TS; ******. The SUBJECT INDEX has been subdivide in three parts to help FIND data.  The three parts are FEATURE ARTICLES, PHOTOS, and DRAWINGS.<br><br>

<a>AUTHOR INDEX.<br><br>

<a>The Author Index is the same data as the Subject Index except it is in Author sequence. It doesn't include the special lines but does have some duplicated entries.<br><br>

<a>NEW PRODUCTS, BOOKS, VIDEOS REVIEW INDEX.<br><br>

<a>This is a new index created for the 25th anniversary issue and is updated each issue.  The index is sorted into scale within 13 sections.  Some of the sections are subdivided into real railroads, models and different scales.<br><br>

<a>The section codes are as follows;<br><br>

<a><pre><h3>A	 Audio Recordings.
B	 Books, divided by real Railroads and Models.
C	 Catalogs.
D	 Drawings and Plans.
F	 Movie Films.
I	 Items used on Model Railroads  and the catch all.
