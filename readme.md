This is a personal project in "small data", experimenting with using HTML and javascript to provide a portable search of the index of a magazine I really enjoy and keep referring to.

The original data was organized by Maynard Van Roekel, and he very generously let me make a copy and modify it.
I hope you find it useful in your own projects.
